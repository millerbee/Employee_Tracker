## Description
  This project allows a user to view, add, update and remove Employees, Departments and Roles. The user can also view the utilized budget of each department.
  I utilized views in MySQL to make the queries in js file cleaner on Select statements and to format the data in the views. Updates, Inserts and Deletes are on root tables.
